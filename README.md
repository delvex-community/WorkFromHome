# WorkFromHome
Objective: To Develop an automation script using Xdotools which can automate the movement of windows and many more

* This Shell script is developed in Ubuntu 18.0 version
* The main objective is to do things for particular period of time
* Since the Requirements were vague, the script is just made to run for particular amount of time ```script-name 5 minutes```
* Time can be changed
* Few functions are being used in the script, on repetitive basis. It can be improved a lot based on proper requirements provided.
  1. Software that checks for Work being done
  2. What kind of work is to be done by WFH script
  3. Just movement of Cursor and keyboard is sufficient or something else is required etc.
* The Best option to do such tasks is to use RPA that is in Windows
